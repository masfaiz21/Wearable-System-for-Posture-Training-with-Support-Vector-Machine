# Wearable-System-for-Posture-Training-with-Support-Vector-Machine
Final project to complete my Engineering degree. Wearable System for Posture Training Triceps Extension that utilizes a combination of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) MPU6050 sensor to detect forearm movements and a Muscle Sensor V3 (EMG) to measure triceps brachii muscle activity in the upper arm.
